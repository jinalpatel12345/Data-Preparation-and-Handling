# Data-Preparation-and-Handling
Group project done using SAS Studio

The dataset we used is ‘Suicide Rate’. It is a suicides survey data conducted from 1985 to 2016. This is a compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum. This project will help us to find patterns and gain some insights on the Suicide Rates.
We used SAS software to perform all the operations.
